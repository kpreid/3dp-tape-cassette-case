This is a case for a single audio [microcassette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcassette) (as used in dictation recorders and answering machines, not a ["compact" cassette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape) for music).

Present features (compared to a standard commercially-made case):

* It snaps shut.
* It locks the tape reels in position to prevent unwinding due to vibration.

Absent features:

* It probably will not comfortably fit a [J-card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-card) unless enlarged, and even if it were it would not be transparent like a molded polycarbonate case.
* It does not have ridges/recess to assist in pulling open the case, but I find that the printed plastic is rough enough not to need them much.

Possible improvements that could be made:

* Compact cassette version — once I have a cassette to test fit with.
* Window to reveal labeling, at the cost of less dust protection.
* Make the .scad Customizer-compatible for tweaks.

## Printing

I printed this using a 0.15 mm layer height in PLA; I have not tried other layer heights or materials. Use no supports. Infill is unnecessary.

This is likely to need dimensional tweaks to work well on your printer. The hinge and latch features have very close fits.

Also, the inside of the hook of the "J" is printed bridged, so the amount of sag will greatly affect how snugly the microcassette fits, but this isn't a critical dimension as long as it isn't too small.
